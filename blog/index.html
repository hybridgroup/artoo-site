                </header><p>In celebration of <a href="http://nationalroboticsweek.org">National Robotics Week</a>, we brought our robot road show to Boston to speak to <a href="http://bostonrb.org/">BostonRB</a>, one of the US's most active Ruby communities. Held at Brightcove's office downtown, the turnout was quite impressive.</p>

                <p>We had just introduced support for the <a href="http://store.neurosky.com/products/mindwave-mobile">Neurosky Mindwave Mobile EEG</a>, so it was really fun to catch the crowd by surprise with our new "mind controller". Of course we had to include some current favorites, such as our version of Conway's Game of Life using <a href="hhttp://www.gosphero.com">Sphero</a> robots.</p>
                
                <p>Thanks everyone who came out to see us, we really enjoyed sharing our latest developments with the Rubyists of BostonRB!</p>

                </header><p>Our idea of a good time involves a lot of robots, and at the robot hackathon that took place at last week's Los Angeles Ruby Conference (<a href="http://larubyconf.com">http://larubyconf.com</a>) we definitely optimized for fun. The previous week, Team Artoo just shipped version 1.6 of our open source robotics framework, and we were ready to let loose and enjoy ourselves.</p>
                
                <p>As usual, we had brought with us several gigantic flight cases of gear, and robot enthusiasts of all ages were in attendance to program <a href="http://gosphero.com">Spheros</a>, <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduinos</a>, and <a href="http://leapmotion.com">Leap Motions</a>, along with all a fine collection of other interesting hardware devices. We had even brought with us our <a href="http://www.rapiro.com/">Rapiro</a> robot that had just arrived from Japan earlier that day! More on Rapiro in a future post…</p>
                
                <p>Here are a few photos we took of the fun:</p>

                </header><p>We're off to a nice start for 2014 with the release of version 1.6 of Artoo - Ruby on Robots (<a href="http://artoo.io">http://artoo.io</a>), our first release of the year. We learned a lot from our great experience at RobotsConf (<a href="http://robotsconf.com">http://robotsconf.com</a>), and this is just the first step forward in a series of new improvements for all of you, our loyal friends. This release adds some powerful new capabilities, as well as support for more hardware. </p>
                
                <p>First of all, the user interface to the API for all of our robotic platforms is now in a new separate library. Called Robeaux (<a href="http://robeaux.io">http://robeaux.io</a>), it is a universal dashboard to robotic systems, written using AngularJS (<a href="http://angularjs.org/">http://angularjs.org/</a>). We're now using it within the newest releases of Artoo, Cylon.js (<a href="http://cylonjs.com">http://cylonjs.com</a>), and Gobot (<a href="http://gobot.io">http://gobot.io</a>).</p>
                
                <p>We've also added more hardware support. Artoo now has a keyboard adaptor and driver, so you can use a standard computer keyboard to control your robotic devices. Please note we do not recommend using a keyboard to fly anything more than simple maneuvers using a drone. Unless absolutely necessary. Or fun.</p>
                
                <p>Another new driver is called the "MakeyButton". Inspired by the awesome MakeyMakey (<a href="http://makeymakey.com">http://makeymakey.com</a>), this GPIO driver allows you to connect a high Ohm resistor to a digital pin on your Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Using this simple circuit, and our driver, you can control your robots with bananas, clay, or drawable circuitry.</p>
                
                <p>Our Sphero (<a href="http://gosphero.com">http://gosphero.com</a>) drivers have now had a major overhaul. They can now keep up with the speed of the higher powered Sphero 2.0. We have also added the ability to orient the Sphero front direction. You do need to know which way you are going at that velocity.</p>
                
                <p>Last but certainly not least, we've updated the Artoo documentation to include better and more complete information. We've also added more examples. You have told us how important docs and examples are to help get started.</p>
                
                <p>Make sure you follow us on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/artooio">@artooio</a> for the latest updates. We're excited about our first release of the year, and we're looking forward to hearing from you what you think about it, and what else you think we should be working on.</p>

                </header><p>It was an amazing year for all of us on the <a href="http://artoo.io">Artoo</a> team. The robot world tour ranged from <a href="http://rubykaigi.org/2013">Japan</a>, to <a href="http://magmaconf.com/">Mexico</a>, and back again. We were genuinely honored to have so many great invitations to present our work with Ruby robotics over 2013. The open source robotics evolution is already here, and we appreciate all the enthusiasm and support we've had the from the community.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, the interest in robotics, physical computing, and "The Internet of Things" has grown rapidly, and we're excited to be part of what can now be genuinely called a movement. We've worked hard to do our part, by improving the platform, by adding support for more hardware, and perhaps most importantly to keep improving our examples and documentation.</p>
                
                <p>Since our first public introduction at the <a href="http://larubyconf.com">Los Angeles Ruby Conference</a> last year, we've had such remarkable growth on the project. This is, of course, due to the support of the community. We promise we will do our part to keep everyone informed about our many activities in 2014. Now back to the show!</p>

                </header><p>Hello, friends, and welcome to the new era of open source robotics! This blog is where we will discuss new and interesting developments on Artoo (http://artoo.io) the cool new Ruby on Robots framework, as well as anything else interesting to the robot community at large.</p>
                
                <p>Since we first showed Artoo to the world at the Los Angeles Ruby Conference 2013 last February, we have been working, playing, and expanding the project, adding more hardware support, and more. From Test-Driven Robotics (TDR) to the Command-Line Interface (CLI) this project is under very active development from our dedicated team, and wonderful community.</p>
                
                <p>It has been said that “the greatest journeys begin with a single step”. We have a lot more exciting things in store for you, dear reader, so check back often as members of our team and special guests share about our work on this exciting new framework for open source robotics. </p>
