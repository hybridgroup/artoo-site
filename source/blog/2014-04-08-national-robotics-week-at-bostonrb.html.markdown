In celebration of [National Robotics Week](http://nationalroboticsweek.org), we brought our robot road show to Boston to speak to [BostonRB](http://bostonrb.org/), one of the US's most active Ruby communities. Held at Brightcove's office downtown, the turnout was quite impressive.

We had just introduced support for the [Neurosky Mindwave Mobile EEG](http://store.neurosky.com/products/mindwave-mobile), so it was really fun to catch the crowd by surprise with our new "mind controller". Of course we had to include some current favorites, such as our version of Conway's Game of Life using [Sphero](hhttp://www.gosphero.com) robots.

Thanks everyone who came out to see us, we really enjoyed sharing our latest developments with the Rubyists of BostonRB!
