The Hybrid Group's own Ringleader Ron Evans got to speak with [Wired](http://www.wired.com/) about the Internet of Things and open source robotics. The interview covers our robotics frameworks Cylon.js, Artoo, and Gobot, as well as what direction we see them moving towards in the future.

Evans also went into detail about his experiences working on Apple's program Hypercard, and how that open source mentality went on to influence The Hybrid Group's other projects such as KidsRuby later on.
