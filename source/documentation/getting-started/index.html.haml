%section.intro
  %h1 Setup your environment
  %h2 Ruby
  %p To be able to run Artoo, you first need to install a Ruby interpreter.

  %h3 Install RVM
  %p
    %b Follow the instructions below
    or go to
    %a{ href: "the RVM site" } https://rvm.io/rvm/install
    for more detailed instructions.

  %p
    Run the following command in a terminal
  :markdown
        :::bash
        \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

  %p Once the installation is complete, close your terminal and open a new one.
  %p To make sure your RVM is installed correctly, run the following command:
  :markdown
        :::bash
        type rvm | head -n 1
  %p and you should see the following output:
  :markdown
        :::bash
        rvm is a function

  %h3 Install Ruby 2.1.1
  %p If you are a first time user, we recommend you install this version.
  %p With RVM installed, just run this command:
  :markdown
        :::bash
        rvm install 2.1.1

  %h3 Or install Rubinius 2.1.1

  %p
    For maximum concurrency, like when you need to control multiple robots,
    microcontrollers or devices at the same time, we recommend using Rubinius
    2.1.1 or higher.

  %p
    With RVM installed, just run this command:

  :markdown
        :::bash
        rvm get head && rvm install rbx-2.1.1 --1.9
        rvm install rbx-2.1.1

  %h3 Other versions supported
  %p Ruby 1.9.3+, JRuby 1.7.4+, and Rubinius 2.0+

%section.installation
  %h2 Install Artoo
  %p Once you have Ruby installed, you can install the Artoo gem with this command:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        gem install artoo

  %p Then install the gems required by the hardware you want to use. For example, if you wanted to use an Xbox 360 controller to fly an ARDrone:
  :markdown
        :::ruby
        gem install artoo-joystick
        gem install artoo-ardrone

  %h2 Writing your robot code
  %p Now you are ready to write your own code.
