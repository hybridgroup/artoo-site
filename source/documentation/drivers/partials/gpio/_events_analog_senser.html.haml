  # Events

  The limits that trigger the events are setup when creating the sensor (see above in the section titled "How to stablish a connection and driver" ), there are `:upper` and `:lower` limits, as well as an `:interval` param that defines how often the sensor should be read; when the specified amount of time passes the sensor is read, if one of the limits stablished is reached the corresponging event will be triggered.

  ## start_driver

  Starts the driver.

  ## :upper

  Gets triggered if the value read by the sensor is greater or equal to :upper (value passed when setting up the sensor).

  ## :lower

  Gets triggered if the value read by the sensor is less or equal to :lower (value passed when setting up the sensor).
