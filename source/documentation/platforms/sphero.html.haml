      The Sphero is a sophisticated and programmable robot housed in a polycarbonate sphere shell.

      The `artoo-sphero` adaptor makes it easy to interact with Sphero using Ruby, once you have your Sphero setup and connected to your computer you can start writing code to make Sphero move, change direction, speed and colors, or detect Sphero events and execute some code when they occur.

    ## How To Install

    Install the Artoo module providing Sphero support through RubyGems:

        $ gem install artoo-sphero

    ## How To Use

    Example of a simple program that makes the Sphero roll and change colors.

        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'

        connection :sphero, :adaptor => :sphero, :port => '/dev/Sphero-WRW'
        device :sphero, :driver => :sphero

        work do
          @count = 1
          every(3.seconds) do
            sphero.set_color(@count % 2 == 0 ? :green : :blue)
            @count += 1
            sphero.roll 60, rand(360)
          end
        end

    ## How To Connect

    ### OSX

    The main steps are:

    - Pair your computer and the Sphero
    - Find out the sphero bluetooth address
    - Connect to the device via Artoo

    First pair your computer and Sphero. You can do this using bluetooth preferences. (Sphero won't stay connected)

    Find out serial port address by running this command:

        $ ls /dev/tty.Sphero*

    Now you are ready to run the example code, be sure to update this line with correct port

        :::ruby
        connection :sphero, :adaptor => :sphero, :port => '/dev/Sphero-WRW-RN-SPP'

    ### Linux

    The main steps are:

    - Find out the sphero bluetooth address
    - Pair your computer and the Sphero
    - Map your device to a unix port
    - Connect to the device via Artoo

    First pair your computer and Sphero.
    We do this by finding the sphero bluetooth address and then running [GortÂ´s](http://gort.io) `gort bluetooth pair` command, you might be prompted to confirm a passcode.
    Just accept whatever passcode prompted.

        $ gort bluetooth scan
        Scanning ...
          00:06:66:4A:14:99 Sphero-WRW

    After finding the bluetooth address, we pair the device with the computer.
    The easiest way to do this is to use the `gort bluetooth pair` command:

        $ gort bluetooth pair 00:06:66:4A:14:99

    Next, you need to bind the Sphero to the system serial port. In the above
    example, /dev/Sphero-WRW. Use the `gort bluetooth bind` command:

        $ gort bluetooth bind 00:06:66:4A:14:99 Sphero-WRW

    Now you are ready to run the example code, be sure to update this line with correct port.

        :::ruby
        connection :sphero, :adaptor => :sphero, :port => '/dev/Sphero-WRW'
