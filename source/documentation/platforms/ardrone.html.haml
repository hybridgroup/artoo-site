%section.how-to#HowToInstall
  %h2 How To Install
  %p Installing artoo with ardrone support is pretty easy using ruby gems.
  :markdown
        :::bash
        gem install artoo-ardrone

%section.how-to#HowToUse
  %h2 How To Use
  %p This small program lets the ARDrone take-off, hover, and land.
  :markdown
        :::ruby

        require 'artoo'

        connection :ardrone, :adaptor => :ardrone, :port => '192.168.0.43:5556'
        device :drone, :driver => :ardrone, :connection => :ardrone

        work do
          drone.start
          drone.take_off

          after(25.seconds) { drone.hover.land }
          after(30.seconds) { drone.stop }
        end

%section.how-to#HowToConnect
  %h2 How To Connect
  %p The ARDrone is a WiFi device, so there is no additional work to establish a connection to a single drone. However, in order to connect to multiple drones, you need to perform some configuration steps on each drone via SSH.
  %h2 Automatic Reset From Emergency Mode
  %p  When you first connect to the ARDrone by calling the `start` method, if it is in "emergency" mode, the ARDrone will not take off. Artoo can automatically reset it back "normal" mode, to be able to fly IF you pass in the navigation like this example:
  :markdown
        :::ruby

        connection :ardrone, :adaptor => :ardrone
        device :drone, :driver => :ardrone, :connection => :ardrone

        connection :navigation, :adaptor => :ardrone_navigation
        device :nav, :driver => :ardrone_navigation, :connection => :navigation

        work do
          on drone, :ready => :fly
          drone.start(nav) # pass the nav object into the start method
        end

        def fly(*data)
          drone.take_off
          after(15.seconds) { drone.hover.land }
          after(20.seconds) { drone.stop }
        end

%section.drivers#Drivers
  %h2 Drivers
  %p Available drivers for the ARDrone platform are listed below. There are three drivers for the ARDrone: the ARDrone for flight control, the ARDroneNav for navigation data, and the ARDroneVideo for grabbing video data.
