      The ARDrone from Parrot is an inexpensive quadcopter that is controlled using WiFi.
      It includes a built-in front-facing HD video camera, as well as a second lower resolution bottom facing video camera.

    ## How To Install

    Install the Artoo module providing ARDrone support through RubyGems:

        $ gem install artoo-ardrone

%section.how-to#HowToUse
  :markdown
    ## How To Use

    This small program lets the ARDrone takeoff, hover, and land.

        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'

        connection :ardrone, :adaptor => :ardrone, :port => '192.168.0.43:5556'
        device :drone, :driver => :ardrone, :connection => :ardrone

        work do
          drone.start
          drone.take_off

          after(25.seconds) { drone.hover.land }
          after(30.seconds) { drone.stop }
        end

%section.how-to#HowToConnect
  :markdown
    ## How To Connect

    The ARDrone is a WiFi device, so there is no additional work to establish a connection to a single drone.
    However, in order to connect to multiple drones, you need to perform some configuration steps on each drone via SSH.

    ## Automatic Reset From Emergency Mode

    When you first connect to the ARDrone by calling the `start` method, if it is in "emergency" mode, the ARDrone will not take off.
    Artoo can automatically reset it back "normal" mode, to be able to fly IF you pass in the navigation like this example:

        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'

        connection :ardrone, :adaptor => :ardrone
        device :drone, :driver => :ardrone, :connection => :ardrone

        connection :navigation, :adaptor => :ardrone_navigation
        device :nav, :driver => :ardrone_navigation, :connection => :navigation

        work do
          on drone, :ready => :fly
          drone.start(nav) # pass the nav object into the start method
        end

        def fly(*data)
          drone.take_off
          after(15.seconds) { drone.hover.land }
          after(20.seconds) { drone.stop }
        end

%section.drivers#Drivers
  :markdown
    ## Drivers

    Available drivers for the ARDrone platform are listed below.
    There are three drivers for the ARDrone: the ARDrone for flight control, the ARDroneNav for navigation data, and the ARDroneVideo for grabbing video data.
