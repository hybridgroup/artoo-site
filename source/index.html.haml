    ## Meet The Code

    Artoo's simple code makes telling robots what to do incredibly simple and fun.<br>
    All you need to get started is the `artoo` gem

  :markdown
        :::ruby
        require 'artoo'


%section
  %h2.alternative-heading Example

  %p Then hook it up to your robot (in this case, a #{link_to("Sphero", "/documentation/platforms/sphero")})

  :markdown
        :::ruby
        connection :sphero, adaptor: :sphero, port: '4560'
        device :sphero, driver: :sphero

  %p And tell it what to do!

  :markdown
        :::ruby
        work do
          every(3.seconds) do
            puts "Rolling..."
            sphero.roll 60, rand(360)
          end
        end

  %h2 Platform Support
  %p
    Artoo has an extensible system for connecting to hardware devices. The following robotics and physical computing platforms are currently supported:

  %h2.alternative-heading 15 Platforms

  %ul.platform-list
    - data.platforms.each do |name, info|
      %li.platform
        %a{:href => "/documentation/platforms/#{info.slug}"}
          %h3.title= name
          %img{src: "/images/devices/#{info.slug}.jpg", style: "width: 90%"}

  %p More platforms are coming soon!

  %p Artoo also has support for devices that can work across multiple hardware platforms.

  %h2.alternative-heading
    = link_to "8 GPIO drivers", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Purpose_Input/Output" , target:"_blank"

  %ul.platform-list
    - data.drivers.GPIO.each do |name, url|
      %li.platform
        %a{:href => "/documentation/drivers/#{url}"}

  %ul.platform-list
    - data.drivers.I2C.each do |name, url|
      %li.platform

  = link_to "here", "/documentation/drivers"


%p More platforms are coming soon!

%h2 API
%p Artoo includes a RESTful API to query the status of any robot running within a group, including the connection and device status, and device streaming data via websockets.

:markdown
  To activate the API, use the `api` command like this:

:markdown
      :::ruby
      require 'artoo'

      connection :loop
      device :passthru
      api :host => '127.0.0.1', :port => '4321'

      work do
        puts "Hello from the API running at \#{api_host}:\#{api_port}..."
      end

    [Gort][] is a Command Line Toolkit (CLI) for RobotOps. Gort provides tools to scan for connected devices, upload firmware, and it works perfectly with Gobot. Also included with Gobot is a CLI for generating new robots and adaptors.

    You can can learn more about Gobot's CLI in the docs [here][cli-docs].
